hi!

Your game seems to be a good starting point for a settlers-like game i would 
like to create for some time. I dont know how it is built, so maybe you could 
tell me what do you think. Is antargis appropried?

You can find info about 'the Settlers' here: http://www.settlers3.com/
Since ive most played the third opus, i forward you there.

Thanks

Charly

I know (and have) Settlers 1, but don't know so much about the successors.
The first version was heavily based on track-building - what about Settlers 
3 ?

Ok, now about BoA (Battles of Antargis). The first goal of Antargis is 
creating a game and not an engine. So the "engine" matures only as the game 
matures. The game-logic is however strongly separated from the engine. So 
with a some effort you'd be able to build something different on top of it.

BoA is still in early stage. So it's likely that there will be major changes 
in next time. It'll get hard to hold the connection between two games, but 
might be doable. Of course we'd appreciate everything you might contribute to 
the engine-code and we would support a litte seperation of the engine, as 
long as it doesn't affect BoA.

Conclusion:
Yes, Antargis might be appropriate. Once you're into the code, building up  a 
new gui may be a thing of hours. The gamecode must be completely exchanged 
though. This way you get a light-weight engine (as opposed to ogre or 
crystalspace) which is optimized for rts-games.

Maybe you want to have a look at 
http://wiki.widelands.org/tiki-index.php  (Widelands) - they have a pretty 
mature Settlers-clone. They are searching for help. This one is though a 
2D-game - which isn't much a problem for gameplay IMO.

Hi people!
It would be really nice, if you could give the release candidate for 0.1.2 at
https://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=3474
a short try and send some feedback on what's to be done before release.

After the release I'll post a help request on gamedev.net. When things are 
settled there will be another IRC-meeting; probably a Saturday or Sunday 
afternoon and hopefully with more people than last time.

Let's make BoA the best opensource RTS game!

Hi Cyril!
Thanks for the POWERPC-patch. I've included it into SVN.
I forgot to mention, that you can now disable widget-content-caching in 
textures (which doesn't work on your box). Simply edit your 
~/.Antargis/config.xml file, so that widgetTextureCache is "false".
This should hopefully fix your problem with accelerated mode.

If this doesn't help, can you send me some screenshots?

Thanks for your time.

Godrin

<config>
  <option name="meshDownScaleExp" value="1"/>
  <option name="shadowType" value="none"/>
  <option name="soundEnabled" value="true"/>
  <option name="terrainDownScaleExp" value="1"/>
  <option name="textureMemory" value="16000000"/>
  <option name="widgetTextureCache" value="false"/>

Hi Cyril!

There were some more changes that need a recompile:
$ rake clean && rake
Then it shouldn't crash anymore.

You can simply reply to the list. Because you are registered there, too, I 
don't cc you.

Bye

Message-ID: <200605192257.01399.david.kamphausen@web.de>

Hi!
Today I've "officially" released 0.1.2.
So it's time to think about features for 0.1.3. There is already a list at 
http://antargis.berlios.de/wiki/index.php/Release_Plan

In SVN's TODO there is also a big list. So we should discuss this a little.

Anybody who's interested in helping can modify it and comment on this.
Now is a good time to get into the flow :-)

Hi !

You're welcome.

Allrounders are always good :-D

There is support for Linux on PPC, so I think it won't be such a problem to 
get it running on Mac OS/X. But we have nobody to do it yet, so maybe you 
want to start it? The best way would be using the source-distribution of 
0.1.2 or current SVN. Infos are on the download-page.

Nice, I'll up an explanation how to include it soon.

> I saw you're located in Germany.
> Are you german :)
Yes, I am.

No problem - it was rather funny.

This afternoon we have an IRC meeting - if you have time you can join us at:

 Server: irc.freenode.net 
 Channel: #antargis 
 Date: Sun 28. May 18:00 GMT (http://wwp.greenwichmeantime.com/) 
 (which is 20:00 in Germany, France (=CEST), e.g.) 

See you soon,too

David (Godrin)
