I know (and have) Settlers 1, but don't know so much about the successors.
The first version was heavily based on track-building - what about Settlers 
3 ?

Ok, now about BoA (Battles of Antargis). The first goal of Antargis is 
creating a game and not an engine. So the &quot;engine&quot; matures only as the game 
matures. The game-logic is however strongly separated from the engine. So 
with a some effort you'd be able to build something different on top of it.

BoA is still in early stage. So it's likely that there will be major changes 
in next time. It'll get hard to hold the connection between two games, but 
might be doable. Of course we'd appreciate everything you might contribute to 
the engine-code and we would support a litte seperation of the engine, as 
long as it doesn't affect BoA.

Conclusion:
Yes, Antargis might be appropriate. Once you're into the code, building up  a 
new gui may be a thing of hours. The gamecode must be completely exchanged 
though. This way you get a light-weight engine (as opposed to ogre or 
crystalspace) which is optimized for rts-games.

Maybe you want to have a look at 
<A HREF="http://wiki.widelands.org/tiki-index.php">http://wiki.widelands.org/tiki-index.php</A>  (Widelands) - they have a pretty 
mature Settlers-clone. They are searching for help. This one is though a 
2D-game - which isn't much a problem for gameplay IMO.
