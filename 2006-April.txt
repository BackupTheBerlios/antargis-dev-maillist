Consider yourself as having another developer on your game.

I have been looking for a project to join for a simple reason: no-one has
joined mine, and 1 developer on their own ends up hitting a brick wall
eventually. I've decided to help you out because of an experience I had on
sourceforge. All the 'developer wanted' posts I was scanning were by people
in the planning or alpha stages of a project. This generally pans out to
'can you program my idea for me?' requests. Not my idea of fun. You at least
have dedicated some time to your project, and that gets my respect. Since I
have built up projects by myself, I truly understand the amount of hard work
that is involved. You at least seem prepared to put the work in, I'm going
to do my best to help out.

However, I must be honest and say that I come with some baggage. I probably
won't like your coding style, and I'll keep bitching that you used ruby
instead of python. However, some level of conflict is in some ways good,
after all the more coders that comment on your code the better it will
become. I'll also say that I'm also lazy in a funny way - I tend to work in
bursts, so you may see a lot of code 1 month and hardly any the next - hey,
life gets in the way sometimes!

One more thing you'll need to know is my skills. I primarily code in C/C++,
Python, Perl and assembly language. I have experience with SDL, and I've
covered the first 10 or so chapters of Nehe's opengl tutorials (i.e. I know
almost bugger all real opengl). I do have the philosophy that any decent
coder can learn a language/lib in a few weeks.  I'm ok with designing some
2d graphics, and I'm not too bad at 3d graphics (I used to use 3DMax, now I
use Blender). I work in a GNU/Linux system, the distro I use is Ubuntu 5.10.
I'm also a musician to some degree (I'm in a band,
http://www.cosmiccharlies.co.uk/), so I'd be prepared to write some music
for the game.

Well, that's enough ranting for now. I've downloaded what I can, and will
spend the next few days looking through the code etc... I'll probably start
by sending you some new graphics/3d models/music or somesuch unti I've
worked out how the code works. Until then, perhaps you could help me out in
some way by detailing some of the structure of the code (in fact, that's an
idea, perhaps I could do that myself and add to the wiki for future
developers).

One more thing - your website is currently fskd, in that the datbase
powering them does not seem to work, which is why I had to respond to the
mailing list - I couldn't find a decent email address to write to. Anyhow,
here's to Antargis - let's make it a great game!

and they'll stick to their pre-alpha-stage until they get abandoned...

ok, this seams as it will be fun :-)
There were times when BoA slept for some weeks, too. And yes, my code isn't 
that fine - there is much to be done about this, though I tried to review it 
a little before 0.1 release.

That's very nice to have someone, who can do (nearly) everything :-)
BTW your game looks very nice, too. Shouldn't be abandoned at all. Maybe
you should try to promote it a little for GotM ? Though GotM seems to be 
pretty much dead after windstille.

As the wiki is quiet dead ATM, I'll try to give you some rough description:
The basis of the project is a self-written GUI-library (gui/src/*), that runs 
on either SDL- and OpenGL-mode. It has the typical structure (ParaGUI,Qt):
* widgets
* an AGApplication class doing the main-loop
* some very simple message-passing-system
* xml-based layouts, examples are in data/gui/layout/*.xml
* some simple theming; look at data/theme.xml
Rendering is done through a AGPainter-class, that then does delegate its work 
to the current PaintTarget (rendering device).

The message passing system is some ugly self-written thingy, which runs more 
or less seamless through c++ and ruby. Libsigc++ made many problems with 
swig, so I left it, same for ParaGUI's implementation.

Then there is a real small 3d-engine consisting of:
* a scenegraph (src/scene.h), using quadtree.h
* a scenenodes (src/scenenode.h)
* static meshes (src/mesh.h and src/mesh_data.h)
* animated meshes (src/anim_mesh.h and src/anim_mesh_data.h), uses 
glsl-shaders if available
* some very rudimentary particles (src/smoke.h)
* stuff more stuff like (broken) decals

The game-engine (C++) is done in 3 stages:
* a map (src/map.h), which contains all the entities in a quadtree
* entities (src/entity.h), which represent game-objects. These can have 0 to 
any meshes.
* each entity can have a low-level job. Those are defined in job.h.
Nearly everything is exposed to ruby. Functions and classes that are used very 
often (low-level jobs) are not.
Anything else is done in ruby - so much for rapid development.

As for the actual game, any entity-type has its own class which is derived 
from AntEntity. This ruby-scripts are all places in (ruby/*).
Heroes and Houses can have high-level jobs (ruby/ant_hljobs.rb).
That's it for a rough overview, I think. 

Some words on ruby or scripting on the whole:
I started this project using LUA and luabind, but I really missed a nice 
syntax for classes and the binding was a hell. So I abandonded it and 
embraced ruby with swig, because of its seemingly easiness. After writing a 
real big load of code I got into problems with the garbage collector (GC).
These were solved by some self-written extensions to the swig-processing.
There are still some speed drawbacks with the GC. But I think they are minor.
Maybe it had been better to choose python due to its refcounting GC - don't 
know. However it would be a real pain to port all this stuff...

Yes, I know. Berlios have crashed their db-server. This concerns various 
projects (lincity,supertux...), I hope they'll fix it soon and have not 
destroyed the data, as I have not yet done any backups :-(. This will be the 
first thing for me to do after the server comes up again.

If you want to get an impression on what's to do ATM or what I'm doing have a 
look at SVN's TODO and the commit-mailing-list. The SVN version is currently 
a little faster than 0.1.1 release, so you might try this one. Descriptions 
on that are on the Download page 
http://antargis.berlios.de/index.php?page=download

Welcome on board!

Hi,

I'd like to suggest some bits:
 - eventually setup an IRC channel (e.g. on freenode or oftc);
 - gather all contact infos on the "People" wiki page (which could be
   renamed to "Contact");
 - have a jabber account if you're not on IRC, that's sometimes more
   friendly to send some lines over an IM account than having to
   elaborate a mail. Jabber's growing and is more and more used across
   free software developers;
 - fix the broken link on the download page[1] to the user FAQ;
 - it could be *very* interesting to have a "no-sound" option; since
   linux audio modules are sometimes broken (like ATM for me), I cannot
   run the game. :/ (It could exist already, but I didn't see it in the
   few docs I found.)

I must confess I found the screenshots very promising, I'm eager to
testing it. ;-)

(Please Cc: me on reply, I've not (yet) subscribed to the list.)

Cheers,

Hi,
thanks for the feedback! We already have an irc-channel #antargis at 
freenode.net, but it's not very well frequented yet :-)
On the People's page in the wiki there are a whole bunch of information how to 
contact us (mostly ICQ - but now Jabber for me, too). The broken user-FAQ 
link was my fault. I've added it to soon. The FAQ didn't even exist, because 
our wiki was down.
And at last it's a good idea to make a no-sound option. This will be included 
in the next version!

Bye
David

I read that just a bit later, and I then noticed the other tabs on the
website, sorry for reporting already-existing-things. :-)

Sounds great, I'll keep an eye on it. :-)

Ok, there's support for disabling sound in SVN now.
You can disable it by editing your ~/.Antargis/config.xml
file, so that is looks like this:
<config>
  <option name="soundEnabled" value="false"/>
</config>
and then running the game.  I'll add a command-line thingy soon.

Thanks for having done that so quickly. :-)
The following is about r772.

> You can disable it by editing your ~/.Antargis/config.xml
That's the first time I see a dotfile with capital(s). :-) (If I don't
count .ICEauthority)

> and then running the game.  I'll add a command-line thingy soon.
I ran 'rake' and got:
> Config cached! - remove 'config.rb' or 'rake clean' to clear cache
> 
> rake aborted!
> Don't know how to build task 'src/swig.cc'

so I cleaned and recompiled, and got the same error about src/swig.cc
I tried to "touch" it, compiling was then successful, but when trying to
run ./run.rb:
> ./libantargis.so: ./libantargis.so: undefined symbol: Init_libantargis -
>   ./libantargis.so (LoadError)
> from ./ruby/antargislib.rb:15
> from ./ruby/intro.rb:3
> from ./run.rb:3

To conclude, no need to Cc: me any longer, I subscribed. :-)

You have to install swig, if you want to use current SVN.
When you've done so, run a
$ rake clean
$ rake
Then it should run :-)

No idea, but it seems like they've solved it. Now it runs again.
