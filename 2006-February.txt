Hello Burhan!
If you want to help your welcome! But I'm using Ruby instead of Python.
However there's much to do, as level- and objectscripting.
So if you want to learn Ruby, too, you can help.
Further information you can find on http://www.rubycentral.com/book/
- that's the book I've learned ruby on, whenever in printed form

David

hi!

There already is an svn-repository. You can download it like this:
svn checkout svn://svn.berlios.de/antargis/antargis/trunk antargis
To build it:
> cd antargis
> rake
But you need a bunch of libraries for this. If you are running debian, then 
you shall at least install:
libruby1.8-dev (or 1.9)
swig
libsdl-image1.2-dev
libsdl1.2-dev
libsdl-mixer1.2-dev
libsge-dev
libsdl-ttf1.2-dev

The instructions at http://antargis.berlios.de/index.php?page=download are 
kind a outdated ATM.

If you get stuck or have any problems, just write an email to the list!

David
