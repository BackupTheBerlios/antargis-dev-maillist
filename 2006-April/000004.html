&gt;<i> I have been looking for a project to join for a simple reason: no-one has
</I>&gt;<i> joined mine, and 1 developer on their own ends up hitting a brick wall
</I>&gt;<i> eventually. I've decided to help you out because of an experience I had on
</I>&gt;<i> sourceforge. All the 'developer wanted' posts I was scanning were by people
</I>&gt;<i> in the planning or alpha stages of a project. This generally pans out to
</I>&gt;<i> 'can you program my idea for me?' requests. Not my idea of fun. 
</I>and they'll stick to their pre-alpha-stage until they get abandoned...

&gt;<i> However, I must be honest and say that I come with some baggage. I probably
</I>&gt;<i> won't like your coding style, and I'll keep bitching that you used ruby
</I>&gt;<i> instead of python. However, some level of conflict is in some ways good,
</I>&gt;<i> after all the more coders that comment on your code the better it will
</I>&gt;<i> become. I'll also say that I'm also lazy in a funny way - I tend to work in
</I>&gt;<i> bursts, so you may see a lot of code 1 month and hardly any the next - hey,
</I>&gt;<i> life gets in the way sometimes!
</I>ok, this seams as it will be fun :-)
There were times when BoA slept for some weeks, too. And yes, my code isn't 
that fine - there is much to be done about this, though I tried to review it 
a little before 0.1 release.

&gt;<i> One more thing you'll need to know is my skills. I primarily code in C/C++,
</I>&gt;<i> Python, Perl and assembly language. I have experience with SDL, and I've
</I>&gt;<i> covered the first 10 or so chapters of Nehe's opengl tutorials (i.e. I know
</I>&gt;<i> almost bugger all real opengl). I do have the philosophy that any decent
</I>&gt;<i> coder can learn a language/lib in a few weeks.  I'm ok with designing some
</I>&gt;<i> 2d graphics, and I'm not too bad at 3d graphics (I used to use 3DMax, now I
</I>&gt;<i> use Blender). I work in a GNU/Linux system, the distro I use is Ubuntu
</I>&gt;<i> 5.10. I'm also a musician to some degree (I'm in a band,
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.cosmiccharlies.co.uk/">http://www.cosmiccharlies.co.uk/</A>), so I'd be prepared to write some music
</I>&gt;<i> for the game.
</I>That's very nice to have someone, who can do (nearly) everything :-)
BTW your game looks very nice, too. Shouldn't be abandoned at all. Maybe
you should try to promote it a little for GotM ? Though GotM seems to be 
pretty much dead after windstille.

&gt;<i> Well, that's enough ranting for now. I've downloaded what I can, and will
</I>&gt;<i> spend the next few days looking through the code etc... I'll probably start
</I>&gt;<i> by sending you some new graphics/3d models/music or somesuch unti I've
</I>&gt;<i> worked out how the code works. Until then, perhaps you could help me out in
</I>&gt;<i> some way by detailing some of the structure of the code (in fact, that's an
</I>&gt;<i> idea, perhaps I could do that myself and add to the wiki for future
</I>&gt;<i> developers).
</I>As the wiki is quiet dead ATM, I'll try to give you some rough description:
The basis of the project is a self-written GUI-library (gui/src/*), that runs 
on either SDL- and OpenGL-mode. It has the typical structure (ParaGUI,Qt):
* widgets
* an AGApplication class doing the main-loop
* some very simple message-passing-system
* xml-based layouts, examples are in data/gui/layout/*.xml
* some simple theming; look at data/theme.xml
Rendering is done through a AGPainter-class, that then does delegate its work 
to the current PaintTarget (rendering device).

The message passing system is some ugly self-written thingy, which runs more 
or less seamless through c++ and ruby. Libsigc++ made many problems with 
swig, so I left it, same for ParaGUI's implementation.

Then there is a real small 3d-engine consisting of:
* a scenegraph (src/scene.h), using quadtree.h
* a scenenodes (src/scenenode.h)
* static meshes (src/mesh.h and src/mesh_data.h)
* animated meshes (src/anim_mesh.h and src/anim_mesh_data.h), uses 
glsl-shaders if available
* some very rudimentary particles (src/smoke.h)
* stuff more stuff like (broken) decals

The game-engine (C++) is done in 3 stages:
* a map (src/map.h), which contains all the entities in a quadtree
* entities (src/entity.h), which represent game-objects. These can have 0 to 
any meshes.
* each entity can have a low-level job. Those are defined in job.h.
Nearly everything is exposed to ruby. Functions and classes that are used very 
often (low-level jobs) are not.
Anything else is done in ruby - so much for rapid development.

As for the actual game, any entity-type has its own class which is derived 
from AntEntity. This ruby-scripts are all places in (ruby/*).
Heroes and Houses can have high-level jobs (ruby/ant_hljobs.rb).
That's it for a rough overview, I think. 

Some words on ruby or scripting on the whole:
I started this project using LUA and luabind, but I really missed a nice 
syntax for classes and the binding was a hell. So I abandonded it and 
embraced ruby with swig, because of its seemingly easiness. After writing a 
real big load of code I got into problems with the garbage collector (GC).
These were solved by some self-written extensions to the swig-processing.
There are still some speed drawbacks with the GC. But I think they are minor.
Maybe it had been better to choose python due to its refcounting GC - don't 
know. However it would be a real pain to port all this stuff...

&gt;<i> One more thing - your website is currently fskd, in that the datbase
</I>&gt;<i> powering them does not seem to work, which is why I had to respond to the
</I>&gt;<i> mailing list - I couldn't find a decent email address to write to. Anyhow,
</I>&gt;<i> here's to Antargis - let's make it a great game!
</I>Yes, I know. Berlios have crashed their db-server. This concerns various 
projects (lincity,supertux...), I hope they'll fix it soon and have not 
destroyed the data, as I have not yet done any backups :-(. This will be the 
first thing for me to do after the server comes up again.

If you want to get an impression on what's to do ATM or what I'm doing have a 
look at SVN's TODO and the commit-mailing-list. The SVN version is currently 
a little faster than 0.1.1 release, so you might try this one. Descriptions 
on that are on the Download page

Welcome on board!
