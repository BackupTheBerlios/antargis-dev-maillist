<PRE>Consider yourself as having another developer on your game.

I have been looking for a project to join for a simple reason: no-one has
joined mine, and 1 developer on their own ends up hitting a brick wall
eventually. I've decided to help you out because of an experience I had on
sourceforge. All the 'developer wanted' posts I was scanning were by people
in the planning or alpha stages of a project. This generally pans out to
'can you program my idea for me?' requests. Not my idea of fun. You at least
have dedicated some time to your project, and that gets my respect. Since I
have built up projects by myself, I truly understand the amount of hard work
that is involved. You at least seem prepared to put the work in, I'm going
to do my best to help out.

However, I must be honest and say that I come with some baggage. I probably
won't like your coding style, and I'll keep bitching that you used ruby
instead of python. However, some level of conflict is in some ways good,
after all the more coders that comment on your code the better it will
become. I'll also say that I'm also lazy in a funny way - I tend to work in
bursts, so you may see a lot of code 1 month and hardly any the next - hey,
life gets in the way sometimes!

One more thing you'll need to know is my skills. I primarily code in C/C++,
Python, Perl and assembly language. I have experience with SDL, and I've
covered the first 10 or so chapters of Nehe's opengl tutorials (i.e. I know
almost bugger all real opengl). I do have the philosophy that any decent
coder can learn a language/lib in a few weeks.  I'm ok with designing some
2d graphics, and I'm not too bad at 3d graphics (I used to use 3DMax, now I
use Blender). I work in a GNU/Linux system, the distro I use is Ubuntu 5.10.
I'm also a musician to some degree (I'm in a band,
<A HREF="http://www.cosmiccharlies.co.uk/">http://www.cosmiccharlies.co.uk/</A>), so I'd be prepared to write some music
for the game.

Well, that's enough ranting for now. I've downloaded what I can, and will
spend the next few days looking through the code etc... I'll probably start
by sending you some new graphics/3d models/music or somesuch unti I've
worked out how the code works. Until then, perhaps you could help me out in
some way by detailing some of the structure of the code (in fact, that's an
idea, perhaps I could do that myself and add to the wiki for future
developers).

One more thing - your website is currently fskd, in that the datbase
powering them does not seem to work, which is why I had to respond to the
mailing list - I couldn't find a decent email address to write to. Anyhow,
here's to Antargis - let's make it a great game!
